ZhuyinIME
=========

This project was imported from the archived Google Code
SVN project android-traditional-chinese-ime.

See:
https://code.google.com/archive/p/android-traditional-chinese-ime/source/default/source

Attempts were made to convert the project from svn to git
in order to keep the revision history, but were not successful.
It seems that the import tools need to have the clone URL, and
in this case it was an zipped archive.

This project can be dropped into an AOSP project and compiled in.
Normally it would go under packages/inputmethods/
